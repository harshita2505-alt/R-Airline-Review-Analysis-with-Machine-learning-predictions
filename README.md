Airline Review Analysis with Machine Learning in R
This project leverages R to analyze airline reviews and predict future customer sentiment using machine learning.
The project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and applies models to classify sentiments and forecast trends.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze and visualize trends in airline reviews.
Predict customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for future reviews.
Provide insights into customer satisfaction trends for the airline industry.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes sentiment trends and key review statistics.
Sentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other models to predict sentiment.
Model Evaluation: Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Technologies
Programming Language: R
Packages: tidyverse, tm, caret, ggplot2, and other libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Installation
